# NoteAppJS
Author: John Stout

For this class, we were responsible for learning and utilziing concepts of Software Engineering in order to create a functioning application of our choice, a fully comprehensive SRS and other documentation.

For this assignment, I created a browser-based Note Taking Application using JavaScript and hosted by VSCode Live Server, utilizing a 4-tier architecture and JavaScript's local storage capabilities. This could easily be implemented onto an actual web server as well.
